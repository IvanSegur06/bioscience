Results
=======
In this section you will find different ways to save the results generated by the data mining techniques implemented in bioScience. 

Suppose you have an object called ``dataset`` in which both the original and preprocessed datasets are stored. In addition, you will have an object called ``listModels`` which stores the results of running a data mining technique. To see how to run a data mining technique, see :doc:`Data mining section <dataMining>` of this user guide.

Save the gene names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This subsection shows how to store the gene names of each result generated by the data mining techniques.

    .. code-block:: python

        import bioscience as bs
        bs.saveGenes(path="path/", models=listModels, data=dataset)

To understand the meaning of each attribute, you can access the :doc:`API reference <../api/api>`.

Saving the results of a data mining technique
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This subsection shows how to save the complete results of any data mining technique that has been previously executed. 

    .. code-block:: python

        import bioscience as bs
        bs.saveResults(path="path/", models=listModels, data=dataset)

To understand the meaning of each attribute, you can access the :doc:`API reference <../api/api>`.

Saving the results index of a data mining technique
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This subsection shows how to save the row and column indices of each result generated by any data mining technique. 

    .. code-block:: python

        import bioscience as bs
        bs.saveResultsIndex(path="path/", models=listModels)

To understand the meaning of each attribute, you can access the :doc:`API reference <../api/api>`.

Saving binary datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This subsection may be useful if the user has loaded a dataset and performed a binarisation in bioScience. Through this function we can store the binarised datasets.

    .. code-block:: python

        import bioscience as bs
        bs.saveBinaryDatasets(path="path/", datasets=dataset)

To understand the meaning of each attribute, you can access the :doc:`API reference <../api/api>`.
