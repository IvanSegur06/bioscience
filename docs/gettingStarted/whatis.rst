What is bioScience?
===================
**BioScience** is an advanced Python library designed to satisfy the growing data analysis needs in the field of bioinformatics by leveraging High-Performance Computing (HPC). This library encompasses a vast multitude of functionalities, from loading specialised gene expression datasets (microarrays, RNA-Seq, etc.) to pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms suitable for this type of datasets. BioScience is distinguished by its capacity to manage large amounts of biological data, providing users with efficient and scalable tools for the analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data through the use of parallel architectures for clusters composed of CPUs and GPUs.

Why the importance of High Performance Computing (HPC) in bioScience? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
High Performance Computing (HPC) is essential in **bioScience** due to the increasing complexity and volume of data in Bioinformatics. Conventional methods of data mining, validation, and visualisation can become inefficient and time-consuming, which is another significant reason for the significance of HPC. High-performance computing in the **bioScience** library enables parallel processing of these data and workloads, significantly reducing the time required to perform complex analyses and allowing researchers to get results faster. This is essential for accelerating scientific discovery and implementing these findings in clinical and research settings.

What kind of pre-processing tasks can be performed with BioScience?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**BioScience** provides a wide range of tools for Bioinformatics data pre-processing. This includes tasks such as discretisation, standardisation and normalisation of data, imputation of missing values and filtering of low-count genes among others. These tasks are essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis results.

Does bioScience include data mining algorithms and what can they be used for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, **bioScience** aims to include a variety of data mining algorithms that are essential for discovering patterns and relationships in Bioinformatics data. These algorithms can be used for tasks such as classifying cell types, identifying disease-associated genes, and clustering samples based on gene expression profiles. These tools are crucial for extracting meaningful insights from data and for driving Bioinformatics research.

Are there plans to add validation and results visualisation modules in future versions of bioScience?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, we are actively working on expanding **bioScience's** capabilities to include advanced validation and results visualisation modules. These tools will help users verify the accuracy of their analyses and interpret results more effectively, facilitating data-driven decision-making and scientific discovery.

How does BioScience compare with other existing Bioinformatics libraries?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**BioScience** is distinguished by its focus on High Performance Computing (HPC) and its ability to handle large datasets and heavy Bioinformatics workloads. While other Bioinformatics libraries exist, **bioScience** offers tools specifically optimised for the analysis of gene expression and RNA-Seq data, providing users with a comprehensive, high-performance solution for their data analysis needs.
